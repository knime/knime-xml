            Reads a well formed XML document. An XPath query can be specified to 
            read only a portion of the file. In this case the output will be
            the nodes in the document that match the XPath query.

        <tab name="Settings">
                <option name="Read from">
                Select a file system which stores the data you want to read. There are
                four default file system options to choose from:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file/folder from your
                        local system.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
                        When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
                        Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
                        Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
                        A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
                        You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
                        relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
                    When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). 
                        When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
                        In case it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.
                        Browsing is disabled for this option.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                To read from other file systems, click on
                <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node icon followed by
                <i>Add File System Connection port</i>. Afterwards, connect the desired file system connector
                node to the newly added input port. The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
                It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
                Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
            </option>
            <option name="Mode">
                Select whether you want to read a single file or multiple files in a folder.
                When reading files in a folder, you can set filters to specify which
                files and subfolders to include (see below).
            </option>
            <option name="Filter options">
                Only displayed if the mode <i>Files in folder</i> is selected.
                Allows to specify which files should be included according to their file extension and/or name.
                It is also possible to include hidden files.
                The folder filter options enable you to specify which folders should be included based on their name and hidden status.
                Note that the folders themselves will not be included, only the files they contain.
            </option>
            <option name="Include subfolders">
                If this option is checked, the node will include all files from subfolders that satisfy the specified filter options.
                If left unchecked, only the files in the selected folder will be included and all files from subfolders are ignored.
            </option>
            
            
            <option name="File, Folder or URL">
                Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file or folder. The
                required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
                File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
                File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
                description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
                You can also choose a previously selected file/folder from the drop-down list, or select a location
                from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
                Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
                    <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
                    Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
                    <li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
                    Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
                    (Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
                </ul>
                <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a 
                </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
                <i>path flow variable.</i></a>
            </option>
            <option name="Output column name">Name of the output column</option>
            <option name="XPath Query">
	            <p>Only nodes of the document, which match this XPath query, will be 
	            read. Each matching node is read in a single data cell.</p>
	            
	            <p>Note, that XPath requires to explicitly denote namespaces. E.g. to
	            read only the body of a XHTML document you can use the XPath query:
	            <br/>
	            <i>/dns:html/dns:body</i>
	            <br/>
	            where dns is the prefix of the namespace defined in the 
	            <b>Namespaces</b> table.</p>
	            
	            <p>A limited XPath syntax is supported. Only absolute paths to
	            nodes can be defined. Among the XPath operators the |-Operator
	            is supported. It can be used to read e.g. the head and the body of 
	            an XHTML document in single cells:
	            <br/>
	            <i>/dns:html/dns:head | /dns:html/dns:body</i> </p>
	        </option>
	        <option name="Fail if XPath not found">
	        If checked, execution will fail if no match is found for the given XPath in any of the files. 
	        If unchecked and not found, the result will be an empty table.
            </option>
            <option name="Namespaces">
            The prefixes and the namespaces used in the XPath query. For the
            example in <b>XPath Query</b> following namespace must be defined:
            <br/>
            Prefix: <i>dns</i>
            <br/>
            Namespace: <i>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</i>

            <p>This option is useful when you do not have the default
            namespace of your document at hand.</p>
            <p>If checked, the namespace of the root element is added to the 
            <b>Namespaces</b> table during runtime. Please define a prefix for this 
            namespace in <b>Prefix of root element's namespace</b>.</p>
            <p>For the example of XHTML documents the namespace of the root 
            element is <i>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</i> so that with the
            root's prefix of <i>dns</i> you can leave
            the <b>Namespaces</b> table empty.</p>     
        </option>
        <option name="Path column">
                If checked, the node will append a path column with the provided name to the output table.
                This column contains for each row which file it was read from.
                The node will fail if adding the column with the provided name causes a name collision with any of the columns in the read table.

            <option name="Skip first data rows">
                If enabled, the specified number of valid data rows are skipped.
