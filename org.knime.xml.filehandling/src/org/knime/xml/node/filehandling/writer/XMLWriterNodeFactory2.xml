    <name>XML Writer</name>
    <shortDescription>Writes XML Documents in a directory.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            The node takes the XML Documents of the selected column and writes
            them, each in a separate file, into a directory. It will append the paths of the written files to the 
            input table as well as the corresponding write status (created, unmodified, overwritten).
        </intro>
        <option name="Write to">
            Select a file system in which you want to store the files. There
            are three default file system options to choose from:
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Local File System:</i>
                    Allows you to select a location in your local system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Mountpoint:</i>
                    Allows you to read from a mountpoint. When selected, a new drop-down
                    menu appears to choose the mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are
                    greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled
                    in this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the
                    mountpoint to enable browsing.
                    A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but
                    is no longer available. You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't 
                    select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Relative to:</i>
                    Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
                    relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current
                    workflow's data area. When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of
                    the three options to use.
                </li>
            </ul>
            It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
            you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
            by clicking the
            <b>...</b>
            in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
            <i>Add File System Connection port</i>
            .
            <br />
            Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this
            node. The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down
            menu. It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which
            case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
            Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file
            system is provided via the input port.
        </option>
        <option name="Folder">
            Enter a path to a folder. The required syntax of a path
            depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\folder&quot; (Local
            File System on Windows) or &quot;/path/to/folder&quot; (Local File System on
            Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, required
            path format. You can also choose a previously selected folder from the
            drop-down list, or select a location from the &quot;Browse...&quot;
            dialog. Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Mountpoint:</i>
                    Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
                    Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
                    browsing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
                    Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed
                    since the workflow has been opened. (Re)execute the connector node
                    to enable browsing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a 
                </i>

                <i>path flow variable.</i>
            </a>
        </option>
        <option name="Create missing folders">
            Select if the folders of the selected output
            location should be created if they do not already exist. If
            this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not
            exist.
        </option>
        <option name="If exists">
            Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already
            exists.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Overwrite:</i>
                    Will replace any existing file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Ignore:</i>
                    Will ignore if a file already exists and continues the copying
                    process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Fail:</i>
                    Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent
                    unintentional overwrite).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </option>
        <option name="XML">
            Options for selecting a XML column from the input table and whether the original XML column 
            should be included in the output or not.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Column: </b>
                    Column containing the XML to write.

                <li>
                    <b>Remove XML column: </b>
                    If checked the column containing the XML is removed from the output table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Compress XML files (gzip): </b>
                    If checked the XML output will be compressed to gzip.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </option>
        <option name="File names">
            Select an option for the XML file names. By default files will be generated using the "File_?" pattern. 
            There are two options to choose from:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Generate: </b>
                    The file names will be generated using the provided pattern. The pattern must contain a single "?" 
                    symbol. This symbol will, during execution, be replaced by an incrementing number to make the
                    filenames unique. The file extension will be detected automatically and must not be specified.
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>From column: </b>
                    Allows to select a column containing the file names under which the corresponding XML files
                    will be stored.
                </li>
