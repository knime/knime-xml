<dt>XPath query for column name</dt>
	<dd>
    Enter a XPath query relative to the value query. The value of this query will be set as column name.

	information based on the "Multiple Tag Options".

	<dd>Choose the result type of your XPath query.
            The result type will be match to a KNIME type denoted in braces.
            There are return type specific <b>Options</b>. 
            You can define if missing cells
            should be written to the output for extreme values of this type.
            If the returned node is an attribute you must embed this attribute
            in an element, since XML cells must have an root element. For the
            <b>Node</b> return type you can define the name of this element.
